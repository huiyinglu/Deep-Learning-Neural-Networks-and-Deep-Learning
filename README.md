There are 4 files in this repository:

  1. Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset - This program includes the following functions in Numpy: a) Weight and bias
  initialization. b) Calculating the cost function and its gradient c) Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent).

  2. Planar data classification with one hidden layer Implemented a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer (using
  Python Numpy library). a) Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh b) Compute the cross entropy loss c) Implement
  forward and backward propagation

  3. Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step - This file contains the following functionalities: a) Use non-linear units like ReLU
  to improve the model b) Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer) (It's flexiable, any numbers of layers) c) 
  Implement an easy-to-use neural network class

  4. Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application Use functions implemented in 3), build and apply a deep neural network to 
  supervised learning (for a cat, non-cat classifier).
